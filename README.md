a flutter Application where i use Sentiment Prediction use multilingual sentiment analysis model and a Camera recognition model in real time 

A fun flutter project where i learn to implement Machine Learning

## Getting Started


i found this GitHub project called FlutterMobilenet, 
https://github.com/MCarlomagno/FlutterMobilenet#

the main goal of the project was to give an example of 
Tensorflow lite on flutter that classifies images in real time, 
which got me interested since i myself am into Machine Learning.

so i made this project were i take it just one step further.
