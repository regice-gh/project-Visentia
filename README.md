# project-Visentia
A Flutter application that combines near real-time weather data with a gambling game known as dice poker.

## Overview

This project explores how to integrate external APIs and native code with Flutter. The app currently features:

* **Weather dashboard** – Fetches current conditions for Eindhoven using the Open-Meteo API.
* **Dice Poker** – A gambling game were you roll 5 dices and see real results, it does not feature in game money and real betting.
* **About section** – Summarises the tech stack and licensing details for bundled assets.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure Flutter (3.x) is installed.
2. Run `flutter pub get`.
3. Launch the app with `flutter run` on your preferred device or emulator.
