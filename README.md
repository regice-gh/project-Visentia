# project-Visentia
A Flutter application that combines near real-time weather data with on-device sentiment analysis.

## Overview

This project explores how to integrate external APIs and native code with Flutter. The app currently features:

* **Weather dashboard** – Fetches current conditions for Eindhoven using the Open-Meteo API.
* **Sentiment analysis** – Evaluates user-provided text through a platform channel backed by an ONNX model.
* **About section** – Summarises the tech stack and licensing details for bundled assets.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure Flutter (3.x) is installed.
2. Run `flutter pub get`.
3. Launch the app with `flutter run` on your preferred device or emulator.

## Credits

Sentiment assets are based on HuggingFace models licensed under Apache 2.0.
